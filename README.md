Bringing Lucas somewhat closer to his original moveset from mother 3, PK Freeze has been replaced by PK Flash. Differently from how you may know it from Ness' implementation, this version behaves like a cross between PM PK freeze and Zero suit's paralyzer.

## ***[New SideB]***
  {Summary}

+Inspired by Vergil's judgment cut from the devil may cry series, meta knight creates a warping slash effect some distance away from him after a short delay. There are two versions, tap and hold. Tap (3f window) creates the hitbox directly in front of metaknight (15 units) while holding the button causes it to appear farther away (50 units). The primary focus of this move was trading recovery options for a flashier combo game. The stats on both hitboxes are identical, and there are four quick fixed knockback 1% slashes to set up for the larger 4% slash that pulls the victim toward meta knight.

If the B button is held down after the first 8 frames have passed, Roy will feint the attack.
